For the sake of the class, I will neglect my desire to create a full-immersion description file.

Pale Luna, the project that I have chosen to embark on for the next few months, is a choose-your-own-adventure game with (hopefully) riddles, hand-made art, and a secret revealed at the end of the game, which should take some time to uncover. 

The story of the project evolved from an online horror story of the same title. Some of the dialogue and passage text is derived from the original story, however, the code is my own, as well as some passages/options. I have a deep love for horror and this has been one of my favorite stories from the golden age of internet horror in the 2010s. A lot of the game is trial and error for the user, as it was in the original story. I'm putting my own unique twist on the end, though! If you care enough to find it once this is complete. 

If you want to spoil yourself about what the story/game is about, the original short story can be found here:

Obviously I'm not following the ending. I thought that something like this would be really fun and enjoyable for the people that do it! I'm looking to implement a feature where the game can take user input and utilize it in ways to spook the player. This isn't implemented as of yet, but I'm looking forward to the challenge!
